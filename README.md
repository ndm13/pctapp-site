# PCT APP Site
This repo will see some major changes as things get consolidated.  As
it stands, `htmlversion` represents what is currently live, `kurotowa`
represents the efforts to simplify the code base, and `pico` represents
the target CMS installation that `kurotowa` will eventually be mapped
onto.

If you don't feel like setting up FTP but really need to make a major
change, fork, merge, and poke me on Discord and I'll integrate it.
Maybe I'll look into a CI solution at some point, but I doubt this will
reach the point where we'll need one.

Best way to get things fixed is still the Discord.
